# terraform-examples

A reference repository of Terraform with canonical and as-simple-as-possible demonstrations of Terraform functionality and features.

## Why?

At Container Solutions we find we regularly need chunks of Terraform to demonstrate something specific, such as:

- A simple EC2 instance

- A bespoke VPC

- A Windows EC2 instance with an EBS volume

This might be to do a basic test of something, find an example to tinker with, or send to someone to get them going.

## Principles

The examples seek to be:

- As simple as possible to illustrate the functionality

- Self-contained (ie limited to one `.tf` file)

- Non-conflicting (eg resource names are unique)

- Clear (eg resource names are verbose and unambiguous)
