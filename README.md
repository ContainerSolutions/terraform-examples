# terraform-examples

A reference repository of Terraform with canonical and as-simple-as-possible demonstrations of Terraform functionality and features.

See here for a searchable front-end: https://containersolutions.github.io/terraform-examples/

## Why?

At Container Solutions we find we regularly need chunks of Terraform to demonstrate something specific, such as:

- A simple EC2 instance

- A bespoke VPC

- A Windows EC2 instance with an EBS volume

This might be to do a basic test of something, find an example to tinker with, or send to someone to get them going.

## Usage

To help get started with these examples, there are scripts available in `bin` and in local folders.

Here's an example run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ContainerSolutions/terraform-examples
$ cd terraform-examples
$ cd aws/aws_vpc
$ ./run.sh
Input AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
KEY
Input AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
<secret>
...
```

If you want to skip the manual key/id inputs, then export them.

See `bin/README.md` for more information.

## Where is...?

If you want to look for a specific example, try the [index](INDEX.md).

## Sections

The code is generally divided up by provider, then resource, then whatever the example illustrates, eg `local/null_resource/for_each`, or `aws/aws_instance/remote-exec/inline`.

Other basic language features may be illustrated in their own folders, eg `outputs/local_file/module`.

## Principles

The examples seek to be:

- As simple as possible to illustrate the functionality

- Self-contained (ie limited to one `.tf` file)

- Clear (eg resource names are verbose and unambiguous)

## Conventions

- Naming examples:
  - `simple` - for minimal functionality demonstration
  - `<functionality>` - when demonstrating something more than minimal
  - directory structure: `<provider>/<resource_type>/<example_name>`

- Where it makes sense, items that can be changed are prefaced with `changeme_`

- In general, underscores are used in Terraform names over dashes

- Naming Terraform resources, data, and variables:
  - use only lower case letters, numbers, and underscore
  - names should be unique between all examples (but across resources items only if a resource; data items only if data, etc)
  - prefixed with:  `changeme_<example_name>_`

- `name =` attribute within the resource:
  - use only lower case letters, numbers, and dash
  - same as resource name, but with: `s/_/-/g`

- For help with automated testing
  - where possible, add some way to enable 'left-over' resources to be cleaned up, eg provider `default_tags` of `cs_terraform_examples` in AWS provider blocks

- Add inline documentation for each Terraform code block
  - `# Summary:` – 1-line summary of what this example does
  - `# Documentation:` – add link to documentation before each block (terraform, provider, variable, resource, etc.)
  - `# Explanation:` – add only where some extra explanation is needed

## GitHub Actions Workflow

On every commit, the following tests run on all branches:

- A `tflint` on all files ending with `tf`

- A `terraform validate` on all

- A series of checks to test the code against standards

On every commit to the `integration` and `main branches`:

- All AWS provider examples are run against an AWS account

- All GCP provider examples are run against a GCP account

- All Linode provider examples are run against a Linode account

- All DigitalOcean provider examples are run against a DigitalOcean account

- All 'local' provider examples are run locally on the GitHub Actions runner

This is because `a)` the tests are long and/or cost money and `b)` the won't work without the necessary auth information being set up correctly.

The auth information for the provider accounts are stored in secrets in the repository, accessible to the admin.

Integration rebasing and any necessary re-work is done on the `integration` branch before rebasing to `main`. This is to help ensure that `main` is in as pristine a state as possible.

### Forcing tests

You can force a test for a given provider (on the `integration` or `main` branches only) by adding a `.forcetest` file to the relevant folder.

For example, if you want to ensure that the aws tests run, then add an empty file in `aws/.forcetest`. On a successfully completed test run, these files are removed as part of the 'success commit' in the github action workflow.
